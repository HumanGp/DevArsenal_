                Array Tools
----------------------------------------------Normal Tools

1. Remove Duplicates
Removes duplicate elements from an array.

2. Chunk Array
Splits an array into smaller arrays of a given size.

3. Flatten Array
Flattens nested arrays into a single array.

4. Find Intersection
Returns the common elements between two arrays.

5. Array Difference
Returns elements in one array but not in the other.

6. Sort Array by Key
Sorts an array of objects by a specific key.

7. Unique Elements by Key

---------------------------------------------------Insane Tools

1. Group By Key
Groups array elements by a specific property or function result.

2. Partition Array

3. Paginate Array
Divides an array into pages with a fixed number of elements.

4. Zip Arrays
Combines multiple arrays into a single array of grouped elements.

5. Shuffle Array
Randomly shuffles elements in an array.

6. Cartesian Product
Generates all combinations of elements between two or more arrays.

7. Array to Object
Converts an array into an object using a key or transformation function.

8. Sliding Window

------------------------------------------------Object Tools
Normal Tools
1. Deep Clone
Creates a deep copy of an object to avoid reference issues.

2. Merge Objects
Merges two or more objects, with options for deep merging.

3. Get Nested Property

4. Omit Keys
Removes specific keys from an object.

5. Pick Keys
Selects only specific keys from an object.

6. Invert Keys and Values
Swaps the keys and values of an object.

7. Check Equality
Compares two objects to check if they are deeply equal.

-----------------------------------------------Insane Tools
1. Flatten Object
Converts a nested object into a single-level object with dot notation.

2. Unflatten Object
Converts a dot-notated object back to a nested structure.

3. Get Object Differences
Finds differences between two objects (added, removed, or changed keys).

4. Deep Freeze
Recursively freezes an object to make it immutable.

5. Map Object Keys
Transforms object keys using a function.

6. Map Object Values
Transforms object values using a function.

7. Key by Value Function
Converts an array of objects into an object keyed by a specific value.

8. Path-Based Updates
Updates a deeply nested property using a string path.

9. Object to Query String
