Awesome! Now that you're up and running, let's aim to build a powerhouse of tools for DevArsenal. Here's a comprehensive list of 50 tools you can tackle, categorized into normal and insane tools. I'll keep them practical and algorithmic to make sure each one gets a solid push.

Array Tools

1. Remove Duplicates - Remove duplicate elements from an array.


2. Chunk Array - Split an array into smaller arrays of a given size.


3. Flatten Array - Flatten nested arrays into a single array.


4. Find Intersection - Find common elements between two arrays.


5. Array Difference - Return elements in one array but not in the other.


6. Sort Array by Key - Sort an array of objects by a specific key.


7. Unique Elements by Key - Remove duplicate objects from an array based on a key.


8. Random Element - Get a random element from an array.


9. Group By Key - Group array elements by a specific property.


10. Partition Array - Split an array into two groups based on a condition.


11. Paginate Array - Paginate an array into pages with a fixed number of elements.


12. Zip Arrays - Combine multiple arrays into a single array of grouped elements.


13. Shuffle Array - Randomly shuffle elements in an array.


14. Cartesian Product - Generate all combinations of elements between two or more arrays.


15. Array to Object - Convert an array into an object using a key or transformation function.


16. Sliding Window - Apply a sliding window technique to process subarrays.


17. Find Union - Return all unique elements from multiple arrays.


18. Rotate Array - Rotate an array by N positions.


19. Sort by Multiple Keys - Sort an array by multiple keys.


20. Flatten and Sort Array - Flatten and then sort a nested array.


21. Sum Array - Sum all numeric values in an array.


22. Average Array - Calculate the average of array elements.


23. Count Occurrences - Count occurrences of each element in an array.


24. Array to String - Convert an array to a comma-separated string.


25. Array to CSV - Convert an array of objects into CSV format.

Object Tools

26. Deep Clone - Create a deep copy of an object.


27. Merge Objects - Merge two or more objects, with options for deep merging.


28. Get Nested Property - Retrieve a deeply nested property.


29. Omit Keys - Remove specific keys from an object.


30. Pick Keys - Select only specific keys from an object.


31. Invert Keys and Values - Swap keys and values of an object.


32. Check Equality - Compare two objects for deep equality.


33. Flatten Object - Flatten a nested object to a single level.


34. Unflatten Object - Convert a dot-notated object back to a nested structure.


35. Get Object Differences - Find differences between two objects (added, removed, changed keys).


36. Deep Freeze - Recursively freeze an object to make it immutable.


37. Map Object Keys - Transform object keys using a function.


38. Map Object Values - Transform object values using a function.


39. Key by Value - Convert an array of objects into an object keyed by a specific value.


40. Path-Based Updates - Update a deeply nested property using a string path.


41. Object to Query String - Convert an object to a URL query string.


42. Query String to Object - Convert a query string back into an object.


43. Check for Property - Check if an object contains a specific property.


44. Merge Arrays into Objects - Merge arrays into objects with specified keys.


45. Clone Object with Inherited Properties - Clone an object including its prototype.


46. Get Object Keys by Value - Retrieve the keys of an object based on their values.


47. Create Nested Objects - Create a nested object from an array of keys.


48. Count Object Keys - Count the number of keys in an object.


49. Validate Object Shape - Validate that an object matches a specific shape (key structure).


50. Normalize Object Keys - Normalize object keys to a specific format (camelCase, snake_case, etc.).

Execution Strategy:

Start Simple: Begin with the normal tools like Remove Duplicates, Chunk Array, and Flatten Array.

Algorithmic Approach: Use efficient algorithms for each tool, ensuring good time complexity (O(n) where possible).

Modularization: Build each tool as a separate module in src/dataUtils/arrayUtils.js and src/dataUtils/objectUtils.js.

Testing: Set up a robust testing structure in tests/arrayUtils/test.js and tests/objectUtils/test.js.

Refinement: Keep refining the tools. Once the basic functionality is working, enhance it with edge cases and error handling.

Once these 50 tools are done, you’ll have an insane toolkit for array and object manipulation, which will make any developer’s life easier. Now, attack it hard—stay focused and let's keep building, one tool at a time!
